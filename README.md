# MARAX
A platform to conduct haplotype based risk inferences using GWAS data.

The project includes two different type of algorithms. 
The first is a JAVA package to run Natural Computing algorithms.
The second is a particular implementation of one of these algorithms for estimating the haplotype risk from analyzing the summary statistics from GWAS data.

This project is founded by the Templeton Foundation.
